Trail Markers quasi-broken database (not useful for hikers, may be somewhat useful for search and rescue)

In the PDF, the title "Distance Posts" is misleading. It has nothing to do with distance. It should be "Truncated MGRS Coordinates with ambigious grid zone `GZD`". However, since the markers are roughly 500 m apart, one can argue strenuously that these are indeed incremental distance markers.

For Wilson Trail, all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q.

For Hong Kong Trail, all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q.

For Lantau Trail, trail markers L001 to L133 are in grid zone 49Q, markers L134 to L139 are in grid zone 50Q (not cool).

For MacLehose Trail, trail markers M001 to M190 are in grid zone 50Q, markers M191 to M200 are in grid zone 49Q (not cool).
