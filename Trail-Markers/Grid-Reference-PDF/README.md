Hong Kong Hiking Trails - Trail Markers database.

In the PDF, the title "Distance Posts" is misleading. It has nothing to do with distance. It should be titled "Truncated MGRS Coordinates with ambigious GZD".

If you are familiar with MGRS or wearing a Garmin watch with MGRS, when you come across a trail marker, you will notice that the Grid Reference notation (on the trail marker) is a truncated MGRS (with 100 m resolution), and the grid zone designator `GZD` is missing.

That would make sense if all the (hiking) activities are within the same GZD, but they are not and here are the issues:

For Wilson Trail, all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q.

For Hong Kong Trail, all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q.

For Lantau Trail, trail markers L001 to L133 are in grid zone 49Q. Trail markers L134 to L139 are in grid zone 50Q. 

For MacLehose Trail, trail markers M001 to M190 are in grid zone 50Q. Trail markers M191 to M200 are in grid zone 49Q.
