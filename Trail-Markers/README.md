Hong Kong Hiking Trail - Trail Markers Geo Coordinate Repository (not useful for hikers, perhaps helpful for search and rescue)

Most of the times, you don't need to use or worry about these trail markers.
They are included in this repository as GPX waypoints for completeness.

On the trail markers, the title "Distance Post" is misleading. It has nothing to do with distance. It should be "Truncated MGRS Coordinate with ambigious grid zone GZD". If you don't know what MGRS is, don't worry about it.

If you are familiar with MGRS or wearing a Garmin watch with MGRS, when you come across a trail marker, you will notice that the Grid Reference (on the trail marker) is a truncated MGRS (100 m resolution) and the grid zone designator `GZD` is omitted.
That omission would make sense if all the (hiking) activities are within the same GZD, but they are not and here are the issues:

For Wilson Trail, all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q. (cool)

For Hong Kong Trail, all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q. (cool)

For Lantau Trail, trail markers L001 to L133 are in grid zone 49Q, markers L134 to L139 are in grid zone 50Q. (not cool)

For MacLehose Trail, trail markers M001 to M190 are in grid zone 50Q, markers M191 to M200 are in grid zone 49Q. (not cool)
