Hong Kong Hiking Trail - Trail Markers Geo Coordinate Repository

Most of the times, you don't need to use or worry about these trail markers.
They are included in this repository as GPX waypoints for completeness.
Note: Wilson Trail and Hong Kong share 5 markers. H053=W009, H054=W010, H055=W011, H056=W012, H057=W013

If you are familiar with MGRS or wearing a Garmin watch with MGRS, when you come across a trail marker, you will notice that the Grid Reference notation (on the trail marker) is a truncated MGRS (100 m resolution), and the grid zone designator `GZD` is omitted.

That omission would make sense if all the (hiking) activities are within the same GZD, but they are not and here are the issues:

For Wilson Trail, all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q.

For Hong Kong Trail, all trail markers are in grid zone 50Q.

For Lantau Trail, trail markers L001 to L133 are in grid zone 49Q. Trail markers L134 to L139 are in grid zone 50Q. 

For MacLehose Trail, trail markers M001 to M190 are in grid zone 50Q. Trail markers M191 to M200 are in grid zone 49Q.
