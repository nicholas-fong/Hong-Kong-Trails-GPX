Hong Kong Trail - Trail Markers Repository
<br>
Most of the times, you don't need to use or worry about these trail markers.
I include the trail markers locations as GPX waypoints for completeness.

If you are familiar with MGRS or wearing a Garmin watch with MGRS, when you come across a trail marker, you will quickly notice that the Grid Reference notation on the trail marker is a truncated MGRS notation with 100 m resolution with grid zone designator `GZD` omitted.

That would normally be fine if the activity is inside the same grid zone, but ... 

For Wilson Trail and Hong Kong Trail, trail markers are in grid zone 50Q.

For Lantau Trail, trail markers L001 to L133 are in grid zone 49Q. Trail markers L134 to L139 are in grid zone 50Q. 

For MacLehose Trail, trail markers L001 to L190 are in grid zone 50Q. Trail markers L191 to L200 are in grid zone 49Q.
