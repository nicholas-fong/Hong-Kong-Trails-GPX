Hong Kong Trail - Trail Markers Repository
<br>
Most of the times, you don't need to use or worry about these trail markers.
I included the trail markers locations in GPX waypoints for completeness.

If you are familiar with MGRS or wearing a Garmin watch with MGRS, when you come across a trail marker, you would quickly notice that the Grid Reference notation on the trail marker is truncated MGRS with 100 m resolution. 

Unfortunately the Grid Zone (Hong Kong trails cross the Grid Zone of 49Q and 50Q) is omitted and is assumed to be 50Q for Hong Kong Trail, Wilson Trail and most of MacLehose Trail. The assumed Grid Zone of 49Q is assumed for most of the Lantau Trail.
