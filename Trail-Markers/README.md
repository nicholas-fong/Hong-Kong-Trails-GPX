Trail Markers (somewhat useful for hikers, depends on personal preference)

Append/import these markers (waypoints) to superimpose on the hiking trails on mobile devices if preferred.

`Marker Nomenclature`
<br>The first letter of the marker (sign post) denotes the first letter of the trail name.
<br>M denotes MacLehose Trail, H denotes Hong Kong Trail, L denotes Lantau Trail, W dentoes Wilson Trail

`Stats` There is a total of 567 trail markers for the 4 major hiking trails. On average, there is a trail marker (sign post) roughly every 500 meters. Hong Kong Trail has 100 markers, Lantau Trail has 139 markers, MacLehose Trail has 200 markers and Wilson Trail has 137 markers. 

`Files` Geo coordinates for the trail markers (sign posts) are compiled in `GeoJSON`, `GPX` and `KML`.

`Footnote` <br>1.8 km of Wilson Trail and Hong Kong Trail overlap each other near Jardine's Lookout. Hence 5 strangely labelled trail markers exist in that area: H053;W009 H054;W010 H055;W011 H056;W012 H057;W013
