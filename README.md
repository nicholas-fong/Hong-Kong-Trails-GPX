# Hong-Kong-Trails-GPX-Hiking
For hiking enthusiasts savvy with mobile phones and offline hiking apps. This repository hosts GPX tracks/routes for the major hiking trails in Hong Kong SAR (Hong Kong Trail 港島徑 50 km, Lantau Trail 鳳凰徑 67 km, MacLehose Trail 麥理浩徑 98 km, Wilson Trail 衛奕信徑 12 km + 64 km).
<br><br>
Methodology used to generate these tracks: using www.overpass-turbo.eu query wizard to extract nodes and export the output (in GeoJSON format) to JOSM editor https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ and manipulated to correct data inconsistencies and other errors. The elevation profile of the trails is derived from NASA's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) GeoTIFF geospatial metadata based on the GPS coordinate of the trail nodes.

Mobile version of Google Maps, despite its popularity in vehicle navigatioin and "offline mode", IMHO it is not designed to use with GPX/KML for hiking navigation, perhaps in a future version. Examples of offline hiking apps are Locus Map (Andorid) and Komoot (Andorid and iPhone). If you use Garmin handheld GPS, simply import the GPX hiking trails. Be sure to bring a fully charged battery power bank and charging cable.
<br><br>
To visualize the GPX tracks/routes on a desktop, I use GPXSee www.gpxsee.org. KML version of the trails is included for visualization on Google Earth.
Both GPX tracks and routes are hosted because some offline hiking apps prefer GPX track and others prefer GPX route.

Due to the length and difficulties of the full trails, hiking trails are divided into sections (e.g. for day hikes). Consult Wikipedia for the starting points and how to get there. Beware and be prepared, even in densely populated Hong Kong SAR, some segments of the trails are remote i.e. no public transportation, no shelters, no food or water and no mobile phone coverage.

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) of Hong Kong SAR created a "Enjoy Hiking" website https://www.hiking.gov.hk, it is an excellent starting point. 
The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) of Hong Kong SAR has trail maps and mobile phone coverage (PDF format). It is prudent to bring a backup paper map for long hikes just in case technology goes badly during the hike.
