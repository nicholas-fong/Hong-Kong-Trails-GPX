# Hong-Kong-Trails-GPX-Hiking
For hiking enthusiasts savvy in using mobile phones, offline hiking maps and GPX. This repository hosts GPX tracks/routes for the major hiking trails in Hong Kong SAR (Hong Kong Trail 港島徑 50 km, Lantau Trail 鳳凰徑 67 km, MacLehose Trail 麥理浩徑 98 km, Wilson Trail 衛奕信徑 12 km + 64 km).
Methodology used to generate these tracks is by using www.overpass-turbo.eu query wizard to extract nodes and feed the GeoJSON output to JOSM editor (https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) and manipulated to correct data inconsistencies and other errors. The elevation of each node is derived from NASA Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) GeoTIFF data based on the GPS coordinates of the trail.

The HK SAR government website discourages the use of mobile phones for hiking navigation for fear of loosing mobile phone signal and fear of running out of power. However, using modern offline maps and medium/high capacity battery power banks, these fears are minimized. But it is prudent to bring along a paper map just in case things go badly. Google Map, despite its popularity and "offline mode", IMHO it is not well suited to work with GPX/KML for hiking navigation.

To view the GPX tracks or routes on a desktop, one can use GPXSee (www.gpxsee.org).
KML is included for import to Google Earth for pre-trip planning.
Both GPX tracks and routes are presented because some offline hiking apps prefer GPX tracks and others prefer GPX routes.

Due to the length and difficulties of the full trails, hiking trails are divided into Sections (e.g. for day hikes). Consult Wikipedia for the starting points and how to get there. Beware and be prepared, even in densely populated Hong Kong SAR, some segments of the trails are remote i.e. little or no public transportation, no food or water, and/or no mobile phone signals.
