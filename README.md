# GPX-Hiking-Trails-Hong-Kong
For hiking enthusiasts comfortable using mobile phone, offline maps and GPX (tracks or routes). This repository stores GPX tracks/routes for the major hiking trails in Hong Kong (Hong Kong Trail 50km, Lantau Trail 67km, MacLehose Trail 98km, Wilson Trail 12km+64km).
Methodology used to generate these tracks is by using overpass-turbo.eu query wizard to extract nodes by name and manually repair data inconsistencies in the results.
The official government website discourages the use of mobile phones for navigation for fear of loosing phone signal and fear of running out of power. However, using offline maps and high capacity battery power banks, these fears can be eliminated.
To view the GPX tracks or routes on a desktop, one can use GPXSee (www.gpxsee.org).
Both GPX tracks and routes are created because some offline map apps prefer tracks and others prefer routes.
Hong Kong trails are divided into Sections for shorter hikes.
