# Hong-Kong-Trails-GPX-Hiking
For hiking enthusiasts savvy in using mobile phones, offline hiking maps and GPX. This repository has GPX tracks/routes for the major hiking trails in Hong Kong SAR (Hong Kong Trail 港島徑 50 km, Lantau Trail 鳳凰徑 67 km, MacLehose Trail 麥理浩徑 98 km, Wilson Trail 衛奕信徑 12 km + 64 km).
Methodology used to generate these tracks is by using www.overpass-turbo.eu query wizard to extract nodes and manually repair data errors and inconsistencies in the output.

The HK SAR government website discourages the use of mobile phones for hiking navigation for fear of loosing mobile phone signal and fear of running out of power. However, using offline maps and medium/high capacity battery power banks, these fears are unfounded. But is is prudent to bring along a paper map just in case things go badly.

To view the GPX tracks or routes on a desktop, one can use GPXSee (www.gpxsee.org).
KML is included for import to Google Earth for pre-trip planning.
Both GPX tracks and routes are presented because some offline hiking apps prefer GPX tracks and others prefer GPX routes.

Due to the length and difficulties of the full trails, hiking trails are divided into Sections (e.g. for day hikes). Consult Wikipedia for the starting points and how to get there. Beware and be prepared, some segments of the trails are "remote" i.e. little or no public transportation and/or no mobile phone signals.
